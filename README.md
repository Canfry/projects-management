# MyTeams
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description:
MyTeams is a project management system. Admin users can create projects and assign users to it. 
The purpose is to be accessible first by an admin as you have to select in the register page if you're admin or user.
Then any users can register selecting user.
From there the admin can create the projects and assign the corresponding user to it. 
Once a project is assigned to a specific user, this user will see on its dashboard that there is a project assigned to it.

Once the user finishes the add information regarding the project, itself and the manager can leave comments for any required feedbacks or observations. Admin has alsothe possibility to delete the projects once finished.

I've used Python, Flask, SQL and Tailwindcss. I've used Flash to display any error message during login or registration process and validators to check if an email isin a correct format.
